        <p>CovidOust is a website that addresses the pandemic. The objectives of this site is to inform the population of the current situation, in that way prevent them from being ignorant of the situation and actually prepare precations for themselves. By being informed it would be less difficult to control the pandemic especially in the midst of a quarantine, wherein the people have no choice but to still go outside and work for consumptions and daily needs. And it would be easier for the government to take control of the situation, if the population are informed and already know what to do during the pandemic.</p>
