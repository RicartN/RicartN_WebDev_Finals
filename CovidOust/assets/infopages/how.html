        <h1>How</h1>
        <p>By using my skills and passion in helping the community, I would present my work to inform people of the events happening all around us currently, especially and specifically relevant to the virus. And by helping to inform people, I would be at the same time be a role model, that you are to atleast give a helping hand to others if you can and have the capability to do so. That would be my perspective of why and how I would build this website of mine.</p>
