        <h1>Why</h1>
        <p>The reason why this website exists is that I, the website developer want to contribute to the society, to the people via informative means. If it means helping even a small group of people be informed of the current situation and kept informed, is a relief for myself atleast. And I have helped them be aware of the situation.</p>
        <p>Nowadays there is social media, and social media often do inform people but there is a high possibility that it is false information, or information that my trigger a false sense of security, now I cannot prove this for I am not a professional when it comes to false websites or not, but I am confident that the information I am sharing is legitimate.<p>
